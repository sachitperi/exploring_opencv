# OPENCV Basics
Objective is to understand the basic functionalities of opencv and understand how it operates on images.
Although opencv is a library writen in c++ I will be using python (python3.6) and the opencv wrapers in python to explore the library.
Opencv's python tutorial documentation (https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-alpha/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html) is used to as the guide.
